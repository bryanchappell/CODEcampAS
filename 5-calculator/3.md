# Core Calculator Functions

The core calculator methods reside in the `calculator.js` file, the `calculate` function will be called from its parent and should have been exposed via module exports. Internally, we want to break down the work into common private functions:

Create a function that if given only one result it will return another function for next result. This is called a Higher Order function.  

```
const add = function (a, b) {
  function fn (b) {
    return a + b
  }
  return b ? fn(b) : fn
}
```

> With these core functions, we want to accept either one or two arguments, this will enable us to be flexible on how we call the functions to get our results. We are using an embedded function and a ternary command.  The ternary command tests for a true result before the question mark and then returns the first value after the question mark if true, and the value after the colon if false.

Try the subtract function:

```
const subtract = function (a, b) {
  function fn (b) {
    return a - b
  }
  return b ? fn(b) : fn
}
```

Now try the multiply and divide using the `*` and `/`

```
const multiply = function (a, b) {
  function fn (b) {
    return a _ b
  }
  return b ? fn(b) : fn
}
```

```
const divide = function (a, b) {
  function fn (b) {
    return a _ b
  }
  return b ? fn(b) : fn
}
```

Lets save all these functions in the calculator.js file.
