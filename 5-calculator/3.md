# Creating the Core Calculator Functions #

The core calculator methods will also reside in the `calculator.js` file. The `calculate` function will be called from its parent and should have been exposed via `module.exports`. Internally, we want to break down the work into a number of common private functions:

---

Create a function that if given only one parameter, will return another function as the result. This is called a Higher Order function.

```
const add = function (a, b) {
  function fn (b) {
    return a + b
  }
  return b ? fn(b) : fn
}
```

With these core functions, we want to accept either one or two arguments, this will enable us to be flexible on how we call the functions to get our results. We are using an embedded function and a ternary command.  The ternary command tests for a true result before the question mark and then returns the first value after the question mark if true, and the value after the colon if false.

In this case, if the `add` function is called with a pair of parameters, it will add those two parameters and return the result. If the `add` function is called with a single parameter, it will return the function that is used to add a pair of numbers.

---

Try the subtract function:

```
const subtract = function (a, b) {
  function fn (b) {
    return a - b
  }
  return b ? fn(b) : fn
}
```

---

Now try the multiply and divide using the `*` and `/`

```
const multiply = function (a, b) {
  function fn (b) {
    return a _ b
  }
  return b ? fn(b) : fn
}
```

```
const divide = function (a, b) {
  function fn (b) {
    return a _ b
  }
  return b ? fn(b) : fn
}
```

---

Save all these functions in the `calculator.js` file.
