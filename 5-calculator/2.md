# API

Now that we have the presentation up and running, we need to create the `api`. The initials API stands for Application Program Interface and it is the signature of functions that we can call to get outcomes we are looking for. In this api, we want to create a single function to call. We pass a collection of data that equates to a collection and get the result returned to us.

For example:

```
calculate(
  Array(
     1, '+', 1  
  )  
)  === 2
```

By having a method that accepts a collection to make up an equation will make the process easier to build the equation and call the engine, get the result and display.

We will create a new file, called `calculator.js` in the calculator file we will use `module.exports` to declare our api.

```
const calculate = function (params) {
  return 1
}

module.exports = calculate
```

Using module exports is a easy way to instruct parent modules on how to expose information for access. In this case, the only method a parent module can use is calculate.

## Exercise

* create a new file called calculator.js
* create a calculate function that just returns a value of 1 for now.
* expose the calculate method to the module.exports node.
