# Setup the Application Programming Interface (API) #

Now that we have the presentation up and running, we need to create the `API`. The API provides the signature  (declarations) of functions that we can call to do the various things our calculator will require. In this API we want to create a single function to call. We pass a collection of data that equates to a collection and get the result returned to us.

For example:

```
calculate(
  Array(
     1, '+', 1
  )
)  === 2
```

Having a function that accepts a collection to make up an equation will make the process of building an equation, calling the engine and getting the result to display.

We will create a new file, called `calculator.js`.
In this file we will use `module.exports` to declare our api.

```
const calculate = function (params) {
  return 1
}

module.exports = calculate
```

Using `module.exports` is a easy way to instruct parent modules on how to expose information for access by web pages and other modules. In this case, the only method a parent module can use is `calculate`.
We could add other methods to our library but if they were not added to `module.exports` we would not be able to use them in a parent library.

## Exercises ##

* Create a new file named `calculator.js`.
* Create a calculate function that just returns a value of 1 for now.
* Expose the calculate method outside `calculator.js`.
