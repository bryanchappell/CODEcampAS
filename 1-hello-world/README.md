In html there are several different elements that provide instruction on how to
present the data embedded with in the element tag. A tag is how the elements enclose data to be presented. For Example an element called `headings 1` uses the `h1` symbol to represent the element.  By included the element in brackets it constructs the starting tag of and by including the element symbol in brackets with a slash indicates the ending tag.

```
<!-- start tag -->
<h1>
  <!-- data goes here -->
</h1>
<!-- end tag -->
```
