# Lists

In all websites you want to create lists of things, using html, we can list items in an unordered list or an ordered list.

- ul - is the element name for unordered list
- ol - is the element name for ordered list

When you create a `ul` or `ol` the items are actually nested inside the element tags. The element that represents a line item, is called `li`.

```
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

In this exercise, create an unordered list of three colors.
