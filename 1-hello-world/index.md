# HTML Hello World

Hypertext Markup Language is a declarative language that enables the sharing and connecting of documents and applications using the internet.

[Demo](demo)

In HTML there are several different elements that provide instruction on how to
present the data embedded within the element tag. 
A tag is how the elements enclose data to be presented. 
For example an element called `headings 1` uses the `h1` symbol to represent the element.  
By including the element in brackets it constructs the starting tag of and by including the element symbol in brackets with a slash indicates the ending tag.

As you saw in the demo there are a number of tags that frame the page including `html`, `head` and `body`. 
These tags provide control information to your web browser as well as setting things like the title for the page.
We will just be copying those tags for now, our work with be inside the `body` tag.
```
<!-- start tag -->
<h1>
  <!-- data goes here -->
</h1>
<!-- end tag -->
```
