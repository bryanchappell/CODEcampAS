Pattern

The pattern is a very simple strategy:

* Introduce Concept
* Demonstrate Concept to Students
* Have students practice concept using exercises
* Walk through the exercises with students

## TonicDev

TonicDev is an embeddable nodejs console, that enables you to create exercises that have tests and empower students to learn concepts without having to install anything on any computer.

To embed a tonic dev code block use the pre tags

```
<pre class="tonic">
console.log('hello world')
</pre>
```
