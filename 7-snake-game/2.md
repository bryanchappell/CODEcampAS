# Snake Game - State

Now, we need to setup some default state variables that will contain data during each paint cycle. Since we have a canvas size of 400 x 400, we want to make a grid 40 x 40, so we want the size of each cube in the grid to be 10. We will make the snake an array type and the food location an object type. We will also setup the direction and default it to 'right'.

The array will will contain a list of objects that specify the the x and y coordinate of that part of the snake.  And the food object is a x and y coordinate of the location of the food.

```
var size = 10

var snake = Array()
var food = Object()

var direction = 'right'
```

The game loop is a tick event that is emitted every 60 milliseconds. To implement the game loop we want to create two functions?

* paint function
* init function

The paint function is called every tick to update the state and paint the new presentation, then setup the next tick using `setTimeout`

```
function paint () {
  // paint board
  ctx.fillStyle = 'white'
  ctx.fillRect(0, 0, w, h)
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'black'
  ctx.strokeRect(0, 0, w, h)

  setTimeout(paint, 60)

}
```

The init function will get called when the app loads, it will be responsible for setting up the state and making the first call to paint.

```
function init () {
  paint()
}

init()
```
