# Score

Everytime the snake eats the food, we want to increment the score and then show
the score. So in the paint function we need to add the logic to increment the
score, when the snake eats the food.

```
if (head.x === food.x && head.y === food.y) {
  score = score + 1
  food = createFood()
} else {
  snake.pop()
}
```

And we need to add the display of the score:

```
paintCell(food)

// display score
ctx.fillText('Score: ' + score, 5, h - 5)

setTimeout(paint, 60)
```
