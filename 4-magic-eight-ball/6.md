# Tie everything together

Now lets tie everything together!

We simply need to modify the alert call in the guess function:

```
alert(answers[2])
```

replacing it with:

```
  alert(
    answers[
      getRandomInt(0,7)
    ]  
  )
```

## Great Job!

Once you completed the app, be sure to add a link to your web page.

```
<a href="[link]">Magic Button</a>
```
