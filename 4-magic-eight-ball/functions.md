# Functions

This is the first lesson on javascript a language that runs anywhere and is very easy to get started learning.

The most important building block in JavaScript is the function.

A function is a command that instructs the computer to perform a computation.

The function takes some input then does some processing and returns some output.

In this example, we are invoking or calling a function that is common in most javascript runtimes.  It is the `log` function, and it is attached to the console `object`

<script src="https://embed.tonicdev.com" data-element-id="my-element"></script>

<!-- anywhere else on your page -->
<div id="my-element">
console.log('hello world')
</div>

## Structure of a function

The basic structure of a function is that it takes some input in the form of arguments and does some processing then returns output.

There are several ways to define a function, in this example we will be using the `function` keyword.

```
function [name] ([arguments]) {

}
```

The basic signature of a function is to provide a name after the function keyword, then parenthesis with your input, the input data is separated by commas, then you instructions or statements.
