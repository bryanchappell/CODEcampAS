# Maze Game

In this game we will learn one of the most powerful features of the internet. This is the ability to link documents together using a `hyperlink` - the ability to link pages and sites together is very easy.


```
<a href="http://google.com">Click Here to go to Google</a>
```

This is a link, when you click anywhere om `Click Here to go to Google` it will navigate the browser to google.com.

You can also navigate within your site as well:

```
<a href="/page2.html">Page 2</a>
```

Clicking anywhere on `Page 2` will navigate to a web page with a name of `page2.html` in the same directory as the current page.
