# Demo of the maze game

In this demo, we will build a simple maze game with a gate and two levels of rooms.

```
                gate
              /      \
           Blue     Green
           /  \        \
      Winner  Loser    Loser
```

Each room will have it's own web page:

* gate.html
* blue.html
* green.html
* winner.html
* loser.html
